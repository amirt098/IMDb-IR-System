There, a blood-soaked drug deal will pave the way for Tony\\\\\\'s meteoric rise in the city\\\\\\'s violent but lucrative cocaine scene, rapidly transforming him from a voracious dreamer into an all-powerful mega-drug lord. Now, anyone who dares to stand in the way of the cocaine king gets a lethal response from his blood-thirsty Colt AR-15. Will Tony\\\\\\'s cocaine-fuelled paranoia mark the beginning of his downfall?—Nick Riganas\\', \\'After getting a green card in exchange for assassinating a Cuban government official, Tony Montana (Pacino) stakes a claim on the drug trade in Miami. Viciously murdering anyone who stands in his way, Tony eventually becomes the biggest drug lord in the state, controlling nearly all the cocaine that comes through Miami. But increased pressure from the police, wars with Colombian drug cartels and his own drug-fuelled paranoia serve to fuel the flames of his eventual downfall.\\', \"When Fidel Castro opens the harbor at Mariel, Cuba, he sends 125,000 Cuban refugees to reunite with their relatives in the United States. Among all the refugees, there is one who wants it all, his name is Tony Montana. Tony and his friend Manny arrive in the United States and start in small time jobs. Soon, they are hired by Omar Suarez to pay money to a group of Colombians. When the deal goes wrong, Tony and Manny leave with the money and succeed in their job.

Johnny contracted Big Louis\\' bodyguard, Tony Camonte, to make the hit on his boss. Tony becomes Johnny\\'s second in command, and is not averse to killing anyone who gets in his and Johnny\\'s way. As Tony is thinking bigger than Johnny and is not afraid of anyone or anything, Tony increasingly makes decisions on his own instead of following Johnny\\'s orders, especially in not treading on the north side run by an Irish gang led by O\\'Hara, of whom Johnny is afraid. Tony\\'s murder spree increases, he taking out anyone who stands in his and Johnny\\'s way of absolute control on the south side, and in Tony\\'s view absolute control of the entire city.

In Chicago the gangs control different parts of the city. As long as each gang limits its activities to its own district, there is peace between them.

Tony helps his new boss, Johnny Lovo, to expand his market share by going into districts controlled by other gangs, kill their leaders, and force pubs to buy illegal beer from Lovo instead. The situation quickly develops into an all-out war between the gangs. Tony wants to be the boss of the whole city. He starts disobeying Lovo, takes over his mistress Poppy, and finally kills Lovo. Tony is now the king, but he has one weak point: his overprotection of his 18-year-old sister Cesca. He forbids her to flirt with or date men.
